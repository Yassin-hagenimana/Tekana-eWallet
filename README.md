Tekana-eWallet Back-end Revamp Strategy

1. Understanding the Current System:

Conduct thorough analysis of the existing legacy system.
Identify pain points, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.
Engage with business units and subject matter experts to gather requirements and understand user needs.

2. Define Project Scope and Objectives:

Clearly outline the goals and objectives of the project.
Define scope, timelines, and resources required.
Ensure alignment with business goals and customer needs.

3. Technology Stack Selection:

Evaluate modern back-end technologies for scalability, performance, and maintainability.
Choose Spring Boot as the back-end framework for its robustness, scalability, and extensive ecosystem.
Select appropriate database technology (e.g., PostgreSQL) for high performance and scalability.

4. Team Formation and Collaboration:

Assemble a cross-functional team including back-end engineers, front-end developers, UI/UX designers, product owner, Scrum Master, and business experts.
Foster open communication and collaboration among team members.
Implement Agile methodologies (Scrum or Kanban) for iterative development and quick feedback loops.

5. Architecture Design:

Design modular and scalable architecture following best practices.
Implement microservices architecture for flexibility and scalability.
Define clear interfaces between modules to ensure loose coupling.
Design API contracts adhering to RESTful principles for interoperability and scalability.

6. Development Process:

Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for writing clean and maintainable code.
Encourage code reviews and pair programming for knowledge sharing and code quality.
Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.
Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

7. Database Design:

Design database schema for efficient storage and retrieval of customer, wallet, and transaction data.
Normalize database tables to reduce data redundancy and ensure data integrity.
Utilize indexing and query optimization techniques for high performance.

8. Security and Compliance:

Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Ensure data encryption in transit and at rest.
Adhere to industry standards and compliance regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

9. Documentation:

Document API endpoints, request/response payloads, and error handling mechanisms.
Provide comprehensive developer documentation for easy integration and troubleshooting.
Maintain up-to-date architecture and design documentation.

10. Testing and Quality Assurance:

Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.
Perform load testing and stress testing to assess system performance under heavy loads.
Implement monitoring and logging for real-time visibility into system health and performance.

11. Deployment and Go-Live:

Deploy pilot system in a controlled environment for testing and validation.
Gather feedback from stakeholders and end-users for further improvements.
Gradually roll out the new system to production while monitoring for any issues.
Provide training and support to users for smooth transition to the new platform.

12. Post-Deployment Support:

Offer ongoing support and maintenance to address any issues or bugs post-launch.
Continuously iterate and improve the system based on user feedback and changing requirements.
Plan for future enhancements and scalability to accommodate growing customer base and evolving business needs.
